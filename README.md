Hey there, I'm Daniel a mathematics masters graduate with a minor in computer science. During my degree I mostly focussed on Differential and Symplectic Geometry (subfields of mathematical physics). Afterwards I've started to become more interested in programming topics and been mostly focussed on that.

I am very proficient in Python, proficient in C++, somewhat proficient in Rust and have some experience in Haskell, C# and C.

My big areas of interest are Data Science and AI, Computer Graphics (in particular technical art), numerical programming and building tools to increase productivity.

If something seems interesting or you just want to chat don't hesitate to reach out!
