# 👋
Hey there, I'm Daniel a mathematics masters graduate (and soon to be computer science masters graduate.

I am proficient in C++ and Python, somewhat proficient in Rust and have some experience in Haskell, C# and C.

My big areas of interest are Computer graphics, High performance computing and Machine Learning

# Noteable Projects
* [Physically Based Animation Engine](https://github.com/Daniel-Sinkin/physically-based-animations)
  * Designed and implemented a real-time 3D engine in modern C++ with OpenGL, focusing on deterministic simulation and predictable performance.
  * Built a modular architecture spanning rendering, scene graphs, animation, physics integration, asset pipelines, and editor tooling.
  * Emphasized data-oriented design with explicit ownership, arena-based allocation for per-step data, minimal dynamic allocation, and cache-friendly iteration patterns.
  * Implemented numerically stable integration schemes for animation and physics, with careful handling of floating-point error accumulation.
* [Script Interpreter](https://github.com/Daniel-Sinkin/ScriptInterpreterInCpp)
  * For a simplified C-style language I wrote:
   * Lexer
   * Recursive-descent parser
   * Bytecode Compiler
   * Stack-based Virtual Machine
* [6502 CPU Emulator](https://github.com/Daniel-Sinkin/6502-emulator) (WIP)
  * NES, Commodore64 Era
  * Written in C++
