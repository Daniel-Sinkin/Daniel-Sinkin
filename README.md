Hey there, I'm Daniel a somewhat recent mathematics masters graduate with a minor in computer science. During my degree I mostly focussed on Differential and Symplectic Geometry. Afterwards I've started to become more interested in programming topics and been mostly focussed on that.

I am very proficient in Python, somewhat proficient in C++ and Rust and have some experience in Haskell, C# and C.

My big areas of interest are Data Science and AI, Computer Graphics (in particular technical art), numerical programming and building tools to increase productivity.

If something seems interesting or you just want to chat don't hesitate to reach out!

## Completed Projects (lines = 1979)
### [Personal Tooling](https://github.com/Daniel-Sinkin/ds_util) (lines = 759)
* AST Explorer (lines=338)
    * Analyses the functions, classes and class functions of one or more python scripts, printing out function headers, total function, class and line count.
* ZHS (lines=115)
    * Alias for different commonly used shell commands which are invoked as subprocess.
* Linker (lines=76)
    * Same as ZHS just that it works for internet links. Also supports groups of links opened at the same time.
* Time Tracker (lines=230)
    * Project based time tracker that allows starting and stopping tracking time for individual projects, projects can be equipped with tags.
### [Snake in OpenGL](https://github.com/Daniel-Sinkin/snake) (lines = 790)
* A (very) simple main menu with a fancy shader effect.
* Fully functional gameplay look with movement, pickup generation, collision, getting moved back to main menu on death and sounds on object pickup.
